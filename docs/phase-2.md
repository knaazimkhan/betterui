# Better UI: Phase 2 - Component Showcase

## **Objective**
Develop a component showcase to display all pre-built UI components in an organized and interactive manner. The showcase should highlight the features, variations, and code snippets for each component.

---

## **1. Plan the Showcase Layout**

### **Structure**
1. **Sidebar Navigation**:
   - Categorize components (e.g., Buttons, Modals, Forms).
   - Provide quick access to specific components.

2. **Main Content Area**:
   - Display selected component with:
     - Description and use cases.
     - Available variations (e.g., sizes, colors).
     - Interactive preview with adjustable props.

3. **Code Snippets Section**:
   - Show the code for each variation.
   - Include copy-to-clipboard functionality.

### **Pages**
- **Components Overview** (`src/app/components/page.tsx`):
  - List all available components with thumbnail previews.

- **Individual Component Pages** (`src/app/components/[component-name]/page.tsx`):
  - Detailed view for each component.

---

## **2. Build the Core Components**

### **Interactive Showcase**
- **Props Playground**:
  - Allow users to change component properties dynamically.
  - Reflect changes in the live preview instantly.

- **Preview Area**:
  - Render the component with applied props.

- **Code Viewer**:
  - Use a library like `react-syntax-highlighter` to display formatted code.

### **Component Variations**
1. **Button Variants**:
   - Types: Primary, Secondary, Outline.
   - States: Default, Hover, Active, Disabled.
   - Sizes: Small, Medium, Large.

2. **Input Fields**:
   - Types: Text, Email, Password.
   - States: Focused, Filled, Disabled, Invalid.

3. **Cards**:
   - With and without images.
   - Bordered or shadowed designs.

---

## **3. Develop the Navigation System**

### **Sidebar Navigation**
- Use Tailwind CSS to design a collapsible sidebar.
- Dynamically generate navigation links from a JSON file or API.

### **Search Functionality**
- Integrate a search bar to filter components by name or category.
- Use a lightweight search library (e.g., Fuse.js).

---

## **4. Add Styling and Responsiveness**

### **Design Guidelines**
- Follow the design system defined in Phase 1.
- Ensure consistent spacing, typography, and color usage.

### **Responsive Design**
- Use Tailwind CSS breakpoints to optimize the showcase for:
  - Desktop: Sidebar always visible.
  - Tablet: Sidebar collapsible.
  - Mobile: Sidebar as a dropdown menu.

---

## **5. Implement Utilities and Features**

### **Copy-to-Clipboard**
- Provide a button to copy code snippets.
- Show a tooltip or toast notification on successful copy.

### **Feedback Mechanism**
- Add a "Report Issue" button linking to the GitHub issues page.

### **Theme Switcher**
- Allow switching between light and dark modes.
- Save user preference in local storage.

---

## **6. Testing and Optimization**

### **Testing**
- Unit tests for each component.
- Integration tests for interactive features (e.g., props playground).

### **Performance Optimization**
- Lazy-load component previews to improve initial load time.
- Use Next.js image optimization for thumbnails.

---

## **7. Document the Showcase**
- Add documentation for developers on how to:
  - Navigate the showcase.
  - Use and customize components.
  - Report issues or contribute.

- Include a "Getting Started" section for new users.

---

## **Next Steps**
1. Complete development of the showcase layout and core components.
2. Populate the showcase with detailed examples of each component.
3. Prepare for Phase 3: Documentation System.
